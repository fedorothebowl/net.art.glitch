This project explores digital obsolescence as a metaphor for social and political decay. Using Python, an image of the January 6, 2021 Capitol Hill attack is gradually erased, with 1000 pixels removed per iteration. Each iteration forms a frame in a video, symbolizing the fading memory of democratic values. The work critiques the re-election of Donald Trump on January 21, 2025, highlighting the cyclical erosion of societal progress and the dangers of forgetting history.
